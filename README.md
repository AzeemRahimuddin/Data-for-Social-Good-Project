# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

As an environmental activist, I want to analyze different electric cars in the state of Washington based on their model, year and electric range so that I can see which city is the most environmentally friendly.

## Dataset 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariusborel/electric-vhicule-population-data
- **City** (String) - name of the city. 
- **Model Year ** (int) - The year the car was released . 
- **Make** (String ) - The brand of the car. 
- **Model** (String) - The type of car. 
- **Electric Range** (int) - The distance the car can travel.
